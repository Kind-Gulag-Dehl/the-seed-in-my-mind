The Mirror (the seed in my mind)

I am an ant. Alone. Creating. Together we could create something beautiful, useful, or interesting. A system and structure and for collective ideation, reasoning, and truth determination. A reflection of hyumuhmanity's most important ideas and truth claims, sorted by all of hyumuhmanity. a record of the past and predictions of the future. A way to sort it out, to seperate what is important from what is interesting.

I have no idea what I am doing in regards to writing code. GPT has been guiding the way as I crawl along behind it, bumping into things. I have bumped into enough things repeatedly, for a long enough period of time that it's sort of taken the shape of something. A seed. You can help it grow. What is the most important thing a single human can do with their time and resources? what can one ant do alone? Should you help the ant? That is for you to decide.
